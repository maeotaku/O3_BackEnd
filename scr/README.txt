Installing brew is simpler than you think, just run this in terminal:
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

You might need to install Python first:
brew install python

Add OpenCV using the following commands:
brew tap homebrew/science

Install OpenCV:
brew install opencv
